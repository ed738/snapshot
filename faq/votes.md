# Votes

## **Why I can't vote?**

To be able to vote you need voting power, your voting power is calculated at the "snapshot" of the proposal. The snapshot is the block number where the voting power matter, if you don't have any token at this block number you will not have any voting power and won't be able to vote.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
