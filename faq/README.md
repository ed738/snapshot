### **What's the difference between admin and authors**

* `Admins` can edit `space settings`
* `Authors` can post `proposals`



## Proposals <a id="proposals"></a>

### Can I edit a proposal once I posted it ?

Nope, you can delete it and make a new one. You can also duplicate it, that will prefill all the fields.



### Why I can't save my proposal ?

* Make sure you filled "Question" and "What is you proposal" placeholders.
* Make sure you've added at least two choices.
* Make sure you've selected a set of actions for voting system, start and end date.
* Make sure to enter a "snapshot block number"

If you still cant's save your proposal contact us on [Discord](http://discord.snapshot.org) or [Telegram](https://t.me/snapshotlabs)
