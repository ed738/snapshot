## Can I use ENS domain on testnet ?

The ENS domain must be on mainnet, then on Snapshot settings page you can use any network for your space

## Can I use snapshot on non-EVM chains like Solana ?

Currently, Snapshot only support EVM chains, if you are looking to use it with Solana look at Neon cross-chain EVM.
