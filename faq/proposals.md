# Proposals

## Can I edit a proposal once I posted it ?

No, you can only delete it and make a new one.

## Why I can't save my proposal ?

* Make sure you filled "Question" and "What is you proposal" placeholders.
* Make sure you've added at least two choices.
* Make sure you've selected a set of actions for voting system, start and end date.

If you still cant's save your proposal contact us on Discord or Telegram
